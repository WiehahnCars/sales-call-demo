Agent: Hi John, thank you for your interest in our rent-to-buy vehicle plan.
Client: Thanks, I'm just trying to understand whatâ€™s included and how the payments work.
Agent: Sure, it's R299 per month for 36 months. It includes maintenance and a tracking device.
Client: Do I need to pay anything upfront?
Agent: Yes, a deposit of R2,500 is required before we hand over the car.
Client: Okay, sounds reasonable. What if I want to upgrade the vehicle?
Agent: Thatâ€™s definitely possible after 18 months, we can assist with that.
"""
